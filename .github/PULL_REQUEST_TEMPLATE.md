# Summary

Implements an end-to-end parking experience with map/list views, booking, payment, and success flows. Adds resilient hooks with mock/real API fallback, and supporting services and UI.

## Changes

- Frontend
  - Components: ParkingMap, Slot3DViewer, ParkingLotCardNew, SearchFiltersNew, ErrorBoundary
  - Pages: HomePageNew, PaymentPage, BookingSuccessPage
  - Hooks: useAPI, useAuth, useGeolocation
  - Services: bookingService, servicesService, demoLots, mockData
  - Removes deprecated: HomePage, ParkingLotCard.js, SearchFilters.js
- Backend
  - Middleware: rateLimiter, performanceMonitor
  - Services: email/stripe/razorpay stubs, seed script, smoke test
  - Config: cloudinary/logger, env.production templates
- DX
  - DEPLOYMENT.md, deploy.ps1, favicon, package updates

## Breaking changes

Replaces the old Home flow and component names; routes/imports should target new pages/components.

## Validation

- Nearby lots render (with mock fallback)
- Booking → payment → success works
- Services load when API is unavailable (mock fallback)

## Screenshots or recordings (optional)
